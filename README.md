In the above dashboard we can clearly observe that the brand like mercedes-benz,isuzu,chevrolet,mahindhra,totota have highest selling price when compared to other brands that are provided in the dashboard.This is expected due to the demand of the brands in the market.
In the early 2000's the count of torque is very less which are provided by the car brands for their models when compared to the late 2000's.This is expected due to the infrastructure of the cars in early 2000's is completely different from late 2000's.
